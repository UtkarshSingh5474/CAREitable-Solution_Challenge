CAREitable makes it super easy for you to make cash & non-cash donations from the convenience of your house. Don’t we all have a lot of clothes, books, and other household goods just lying at some corner and getting dusted. It’s time to give them a new life by donating them to those who in need and bring smiles on their faces!! Your donations will bevisible to all the local NGOs like orphanages, old age homes etc. The owner of these NGOs can directly contact you and schedule a pickup.



## What it can do?
People nowadays have become more and more busy in their lives that they forgot about giving back to the society. Even if they wanted to donate they couldn't as they fear that the donations would go to right hands. They also did not want to get out from their comfort zones and look for local NGS to donate to. To solve this problem, This app can provide various solutions to these individuals. Using this app donors can post any item they want to donate with detailed images and description. Their donation listing will  be visible to their local NGOs or any other location they want to post. The NGO owners can then contact these donors from their listing to schedule a pickup.
