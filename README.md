# CAREitable - Charities & Donations
CAREitable is an Android app that makes it super easy for you to make cash & non-cash donations from the convenience of your home. With CAREitable, you can easily donate clothes, books, and other household goods to those in need, and bring smiles to their faces. Your donations will be visible to all the local NGOs like orphanages, old age homes, etc., andthese NGOs or needy individuals can directly contact you to schedule a pickup.

 CAREitable also features a charity section where users can donate cash to registered charitable organizations. It also has a AI Chatbot called CAREtaker that provides real-time suggestions and answers common questions about charitable activities and donations

## Features
- Location-specific donations: Users can post donation ads specific to their location, offering a wide range of items to local NGOs and individuals in need. These ads are visible to users within the specified location, creating a targeted and impactful donation experience.

- Charity enlistment for organizations: Charitable organizations can enlist themselves in the app, providing detailed information about their mission and work. Users can browse and choose their preferred charity to donate cash directly online, promoting transparency and enabling direct support to trusted organizations.

- CAREtaker chatbot: Our intelligent chatbot, CAREtaker, is purpose-built to address the challenges of the app's problem statement. It dynamically suggests donations and charities from our comprehensive database, taking into account user preferences and needs. Additionally, the chatbot assists users by answering common questions related to charity and donations, providing a seamless and interactive experience.

- Verified account system: We prioritize the authenticity and trustworthiness of our platform by implementing a verified account system. This ensures that users can donate and receive donations with confidence, fostering a secure and reliable donation ecosystem.

- Optional delivery service for NGOs: To facilitate the transfer of donation items, we offer an optional delivery service. NGOs can opt for this service, which calculates a fair price based on the distance between the donor and the NGO's location. This feature streamlines the logistics process and ensures that donations reach their intended recipients efficiently (under developement)

## Future of CAREitable

- Implementing a Paid Delivery Service: Introducing an option for organizations to offer paid delivery services for donated items would provide a convenient and reliable way to transport items from donors to NGOs or organizations. This feature would further streamline the donation process and increase the efficiency of delivering donated goods.

- Improving the Chatbot Experience: We plan to enhance our AI chatbot, CAREtaker, by giving it access to more data, including user data. This will enable the chatbot to provide more accurate and personalized insights, recommendations, and support to users. By leveraging user data, the chatbot can better understand user preferences and tailor its responses accordingly.

- Implementing Global Coverage: Expanding our app's reach to every country, state, and city would enable users from around the world to access and benefit from our platform. This global expansion would help us connect a larger audience with charitable causes and organizations, fostering a global community of donors.

- Language Translations: Adding language translation capabilities to our app would ensure that users from different linguistic backgrounds can easily navigate and interact with the platform. This feature would remove language barriers and make our solution more accessible and inclusive.

- Enhanced User Verification: Implementing a more robust user registration process, such as linking national identity verification, would help reduce fraud and spam donation ads. This additional layer of verification would ensure that the platform maintains a trusted environment for donors and organizations.

- Smart Categories that will give more personalized fields to be filled by the donor according to the category. For example, for food items, fields like expiry date, type. Size and gender for clothes, etc.

- Image Recognition: We can use machine learning to recognize the items that users are donating by analyzing the images uploaded by users. This can be done by using various image recognition APIs and libraries such as TensorFlow and Google Cloud Vision API. This can help in improving the accuracy of the donated item's category and description.

- Fraud Detection: Machine learning can be used to detect fraudulent donations by analyzing user behavior patterns and other data. By identifying and blocking fraudulent donations, we can ensure the transparency and authenticity of the platform.

- Natural Language Processing: We can use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand the user's descriptions of donated items better. This can help in categorizing and sorting items more accurately, improving the search feature, and enhancing the overall user experience.
